                Hi there! My name is Andrew.
                I'm a up and coming web developer. So far in my short time on the internet I've learned Python, HTML/CSS, Javascript, Vue, and Django.

                Although I've just recently started learning programming and development, I've been working with all kinds of technology.

                I was a nuclear Electrician in the Navy, I've messed with motors, hung off the sides of massive generators, qualified aerospace electronics, 
                and so many more crazy and wonderful experiences. It's my hope you let me share all I've learned with you.<br>
                Now come on in and have a look around.
            </p>


            <p class=" right-intro"> This is a different paragraph in where I talke about other things that deal
                with me and other experiences. I could probably go in to places I've studied at and other things. </p>
            </div>
            
        </div>
        
        <div class="bottom">
            
            <div class="top">

                <p>
                    Maybe another thing here.
                </p>

            <p>then one big paragraph and a list of things that would be of interest to employers.</p>
