                Hi there! My name is <b>Andrew Croy </b>.
                I'm a up and coming Software developer. So far I've learned Python, HTML/CSS, Javascript, Vue, and Django.

                Although I've just recently started learning programming and development, I've been working with all kinds of technology.

                I was a Nuclear Electrician in the Navy, I've messed with motors, hung off the sides of massive generators, qualified aerospace electronics, automated test systems and so many more crazy and wonderful experiences. It's my hope you let me share all I've learned with you.<br>
                <br>
                </p>


                <p class=" right-intro"> After the Navy, I went to the PDX Code Guild to start my journey.
                     Right now I am currently polishing my skills at Vue.js and Django as well as diving into Deep learning/Machine Learning.</p>

                            <q>Our students learn <span>fundamentals in Python </span> which we expand upon with <span>JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3 into full stack development </span> with one of Python’s most popular and widely used frameworks: <span>Django</span>.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            In addition to Full-Stack Python (Which includes Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Django, Database design, API’s and more), Bootcamp students learn all of the foundational professional skills programmers use everyday in almost every programming language.</q>

                            The <b>naval nuclear program is widely acknowledged as having the most demanding academic program in the U.S. military.</b> Academics proceed at a rapid pace with high academic standards enforced in all subjects. Students typically spend 40-45 hours per week in the classroom with an additional 10 to 35 hours per week of study outside of lecture hours. </q>
